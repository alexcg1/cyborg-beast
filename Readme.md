This is a modified version of the [Cyborg Beast](http://cyborgbeast.org/) prosthetic hand. My modifications include:

1. Printing out Chicago fasteners (since we can't find them where we are), based on [NewtonRob's design from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:266673)
2. Removing some unused files, such as different versions of gauntlet

Note: The Chicago fasteners are scaled for a 140% scale hand (i.e. sized for a 16-year-old, according to the sizing chart). Be sure to modify the scad file to suit your hand

Note 2: We printed this at 140% scale. I can't remember if we scaled the STL files themselves, or just scaled them in our slicer before printing. I'll look into this in the next few days, but just be aware!
