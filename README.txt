# Summary

All files can be found under the "Thing Files'' tab right below the photos of our hands. Please click download all file to get all components of the hands.   
For More information on assembly or the research, please go to http://www.cyborgbeast.org  

To make the Normal Hand Version, print and scale the following:  
1x Right OR Left Palm  
1x Normal Gauntlet or Normal Gauntlet w Tensioner  
4x Finger Phal  
4x Finger w Bumps OR Finger wo Bumps  
1x Thumb Phalange  
1x Thumb Finger w Bumps OR Thumb Finger wo Bumps  
To make the No Thumb Hand Version, print and scale the following:  
1x R No Thumb Palm OR L No Thumb Palm  
1x R One Hinge Gauntlet OR L One Hinge Gauntlet  
4x Finger Phal  
4x Finger w Bumps OR Finger wo Bumps  

Ulnar/Radial Deviation Hand, Movable Thumb Hand, and Cyborg Arm --> Soon to be released.  

Most voluntary closing devices including this design need sufficient wrist movement and strength for proper function. This design doesn't require Orthoplastic.  The fingers are designed for better gripping and to avoid over extension of the proximal phalange and distal finger segment.  It fits a 1 to 2 mm cabling and elastic bands.

# Instructions

Assembly instructions can be found on the website http://www.cyborgbeast.org  
Printing Instructions:  
Infill: Depends on age. We usually do 30% infill.  
Number of Shells? 2  
Temp? Depends on Plastic recommendations. But 230 c is safe estimate for all types.   
Speed? For better quality, lower your speed to 60mm/sec extrusion and 90mm/sec for traveling  
Orientation: The same as the objects load onto the build plate. We designed the STL files for ease of use so you do not need to change much.  

See Manual as a PDF files.   
Jeremy Simon made a very instructive and educational videos for the assembling and testing of the Cyborg Beast. Thank you to Jeremy Simon and 3Duniverse.org.
